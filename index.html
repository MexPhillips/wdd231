    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Phillip Kaluba, a passionate software engineering student at BYU with a deep love for learning and problem-solving. I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions whether it's debugging code, refining web layouts, or optimizing accessibility. My journey is fueled by curiosity, resilience, and a commitment to growth. I enjoy building clean, responsive websites that not only function well but also look great. Every project is a chance to improve, iterate, and push my skills further. Welcome to my course homepage a reflection of my progress, creativity, and drive to succeed.
